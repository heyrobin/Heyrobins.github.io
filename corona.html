            It's been a year since the new infectious virus has been discovered that affected our lives and some of us
            even lost someone we know to this deadly virus. we were not prepared for it and we have never thought this
            virus will shift our lives from open to the lockdown phase.

            Here is my analysis for SARS-CoV-2 a.k.a corona-virus. It is a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by
            coronavirus 2. The virus was first identified in December 2019 in the district of China, Wuhan. Later on 30
            January 2020, The World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2(covid-19) as a Public Health Emergency of
            International Concern. Right after 1.5 months on 11 March 2020, it was declared as a Pandemic.

    <p class="text-container">“flattening the curve” to minimize the impact of COVID-19 coronavirus. “Rather than
        letting
        the virus quickly rampage through the population and burn itself out fast, the idea is to spread all those
        infections out over a longer period of time,” McQueen explained. We do this by reducing the only mathematical
        parameter we can control, which is the number of people who are exposed to the virus.

        Even if everyone on Earth had paid sick leave and access to effective masks and hundreds of other hypotheticals,
        we could likely still not reduce the exposure to true zero. But even small changes on an individual scale mean a
        big difference in the full scope of healthcare.

        Think of all the people who might still attend a big concert or the gigantic construction convention happening
        in Las Vegas right now. Every person who walks into a convention with 100,000 other people has immediately sent
        their contact factor and their overall viral reproductive ratio into the stratosphere.</p>
